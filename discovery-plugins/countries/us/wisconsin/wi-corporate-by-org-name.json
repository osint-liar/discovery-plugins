  "Description": "The Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions' Corporation Search tool is a public database that provides detailed information about businesses registered in the state of Wisconsin. Users can search for corporations, limited liability companies (LLCs), partnerships, and other entities to access details such as business names, registration numbers, statuses (active or inactive), registered agents, and filing histories. This tool is a valuable resource in open-source intelligence (OSINT) investigations, as it allows analysts to verify the legitimacy of companies, map corporate networks, identify associated individuals or entities, and investigate business relationships or potential shell companies. By leveraging this database, researchers can uncover patterns and connections that may reveal fraud, financial irregularities, or hidden ownership structures.",
