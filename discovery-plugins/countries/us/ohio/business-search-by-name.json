  "Description": "\nThe Ohio Secretary of State's Business Search tool, available at https://businesssearch.ohiosos.gov/, is a publicly accessible database that provides detailed information on businesses registered in Ohio. Users can search for entities by name, registration number, or agent name to access information such as business status (active or inactive), formation date, type of entity (LLC, corporation, etc.), and the name and address of the registered agent. In the context of open-source intelligence (OSINT), this tool is invaluable for investigating the individuals or entities associated with a business. By identifying registered agents and their connections to multiple businesses, analysts can uncover networks, detect shell companies, or verify compliance with state regulations. The database is frequently used for due diligence, fraud investigations, and understanding business relationships in Ohio.",
