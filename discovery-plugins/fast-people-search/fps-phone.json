  "Description": "The phone lookup feature on the Fast People Search website allows users to search for detailed information associated with a phone number. This includes identifying the owner's name, address, and potentially related individuals or businesses. It can also provide insights into the phone type (mobile, landline, or VoIP) and geographic location. This tool is useful for verifying unknown callers, reconnecting with acquaintances, or conducting background research. It serves as a valuable resource for personal inquiries or Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) investigations by offering quick and accessible public data.",
